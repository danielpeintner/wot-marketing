<h2>W3C WoT â€“ Use Case Task Force</h2>
    <p>The WoT Use Case task force is responsible for 
    collecting use cases for WoT and extracting requirements.
    Use cases can include both specific vertical applications
    as well as relevant horizontal technologies or other horizontal usage patterns.
    Guests who are not WoT members but who have an interest in 
    specific vertical application domains, technologies, or usage patterns
    are explicitly invited to engage with this task force to provide input.

        <h4>WoT Use Cases and Requirements</h4>
            <p>The WoT Use Cases and Requirements document includes a catalog and
            taxonomy of use cases and a set of general requirements extracted
            from an analysis of these use cases.  These requirements are then
            used to drive the development of other normative WoT specifications.
